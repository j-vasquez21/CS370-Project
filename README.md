# CS370-Project

## Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?

For this project, we design an intelligent agent for a treasure hunting game. The intelligent agent is a pirate NPC with the goal of finding a path to the treasure before the player does. To do this we used reinforcement learning to train the pirate how to navigate the maze and find the path to the treasure. Specifically, the reinforcement learning algorithm that we implement is the deep Q learning algorithm. To start, we were given the code for the treasure maze, game experience, and treasure hunt game. We are tasked with designing the deep Q learning algorithm. 

## Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
* What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
* How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
* What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?

In essence, computer scientists are problem solvers that design algorithms as solutions to problems. As a computer scientist, approaching a problems starts with understanding the problem first. After gaining a strong understanding of the problem, we start designing an algorithm or solution to the problem. This entails listing out the logical steps that are required for solving the problem. As a computer scientist, my ethical responsibilities to the end users are to create solutions that are safe and functional. Any solution of that utilizes user data will require extra care with protecting the user's data and being transparent with what is collected and how it is used. Ethical resposibilities to the organization are to perform to the highest standard, protect the organization's data, and being transparent and honest with the work that is done.
